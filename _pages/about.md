Hi! 👋🏾 Welcome to my corner of the internet 🌐. 

I am an Assistant Professor in the [Computer Science 💻 Department](https://www.furman.edu/academics/computer-science/) at [Furman University](https://www.furman.edu) <b>🏫</b>.

I received my PhD 🎓 from State University of New York 🗽 at Stony Brook advised by Dr. Steven Skiena and Dr. Lilianne Mujica Parodi.

My research interests lie at the intersection of data science 📊, machine learning🤖, computational neuroscience 🧠 and computational social science ⚖️. 

For a longer biography, please see my Furman faculty page.
